# Scottish Government Introduction to R course

The Scottish Government Introduction to R course will help you get started using R for data manipulation and analysis.
The training will take place over Teams. Over three half-day sessions you will work with experienced R-user colleagues to learn the simple but powerful "tidyverse" suite in RStudio.

This short course also includes introductory material on the use of "ggplot" to produce charts, and RMarkdown - a widely-used system for creating typeset documents with embedded data analysis.

Before the classroom sessions there will be a start-up session where you can get help setting up the R software needed for the course.

This course has been designed by and for Scottish Government analysts. It will provide a foundation for future applications of the R language in statistical modelling, RShiny apps and Reproducible Analytical Pipelines.

[Optional: We are also trialling a self-study option for this course and volunteers are being sought to review the material outside of a classroom setting.]
